# IDE Supported Features

Pyrefly’s language server powers a complete editing experience while **fully disabling Pylance**, ensuring no interference between checkers.

> Each feature below links to the [official LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) and shows what’s currently supported by Pyrefly.

---

### [Go to definition](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_definition)

Jump to where a symbol was originally defined with a click or <kbd>F12</kbd>. If there is both a `.pyi` and `.py` file, we will jump to the `.py`.

### [Go to type definition](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_typeDefinition)

Navigate to the underlying type of any expression. If the expression is a type, we will navigate to the `.pyi` file if both a `.py` and `.pyi` exist.

### [Inlay hints](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint)

Inline hints for types, parameter names, and return values.

:::info
We reuse Pyright's `python.analysis.inlayHints.<>` settings for backwards compatibility. If you have or had Pyright, check these settings if inlay hints do not appear.
:::

You can turn inlay hints on or off using the [VSCode Setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/editingevolved#_inlay-hints) `editor.inlayHints.enabled`.


Inlay hints can be double clicked to insert them as an annotation.
<video

  width="720"
  muted
  loop
  autoPlay
  playsInline
  preload="metadata"
/>

Go-to-definition can be used on a type in an inlay hint to jump its definition. This works even if the type isn't explicitly imported by the current file.

### [Notebook support](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notebookDocument)

Pyrefly provides language services for Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code and also in Jupyter Lab.

In Jupyter Lab, once you install the [jupyterlab-lsp](https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) extension, and Pyrefly will appear on the list of automatically-detected language servers.

Notebook support is experimental. Please report any bugs on our Github.
