# Pyrefly Report

Understanding how much of your codebase is annotated with types can help you track progress toward full type coverage. The `pyrefly report` command produces a machine-readable JSON report with information about functions, classes, and error suppressions in your code.

:::warning Experimental
This feature is experimental. The output format and behavior may change in future releases without notice.
:::

## Usage

Run `pyrefly report` on a file or directory:

```
pyrefly report path/to/file.py
pyrefly report path/to/directory/
```

The command outputs a JSON object keyed by file path. For each file, the report includes:

- **Line count** — the total number of lines in the file.
- **Functions** — every function and method, including its fully-qualified name, parameter annotations, and return annotation.
- **Classes** — every class, along with a list of incompletely-annotated attributes (including those inherited from base classes).
- **Suppressions** — every `# pyrefly: ignore[...]` comment, with the suppressed error codes.

You can pipe the output to other tools (e.g. `jq`) or ingest it into dashboards to track annotation coverage over time.
