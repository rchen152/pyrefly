# Pyrefly JAX shape stubs

This package is a PEP 561 stub-only distribution. It installs the `jax-stubs`
stub package so Pyrefly can discover shape-aware stubs for the runtime `jax`
package without replacing or shadowing JAX itself. It is versioned in lockstep
with Pyrefly and depends on the matching `pyrefly-shape-extensions` package.

Shape-typed fixture stubs for a subset of JAX. This is a starting point for
working with the JAX core team rather than a complete model: it covers array
creation, broadcasting arithmetic, `matmul`, `reshape`, `transpose`, the
`axis`/`keepdims` reductions, and the elementwise activations in `jax.nn`.
Dimensions are modeled and dtypes are not, so adding dtypes later means modeling
JAX's own defaults (`float32` and `int32`) rather than copying the NumPy stubs.

Shape rules use the type-level DSL, `@type_shape_dsl_function`, exclusively. A
rule the DSL cannot express yet returns a gradual shape instead. Where a rule is
imprecise for that reason, the stub says so at the definition, along with
whether a fix is expected.

`TENSOR_SHAPES_CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repository root covers the workflow, and
`tensor-shapes/run_tests.py` runs the tests. Pyrefly checks the stubs themselves
and every `test/test_*.py`, and those same test files then run against real
JAX, so a stub that is self-consistent but wrong still fails.

Before submitting a change, format this package with Ruff from the repository
root:

```bash
uv tool run --from ruff==0.16.5 ruff format tensor-shapes/pyrefly-jax-stubs
```

Anything not listed above is simply absent rather than modeled loosely, so it is
reported as a missing attribute rather than inferred gradually.
