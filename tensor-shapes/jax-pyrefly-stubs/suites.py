    Listing the files by hand would let a new `test/test_*.py` be silently
    neither type checked nor executed while the runner still reported success.
    Names are derived from the file name, so `test_reductions.py` stays
    addressable as `--suite reductions`.

    Every suite sets `expectations`: these files pair a `# E:` marker with the
    error JAX itself raises, so both halves of a rejection are asserted
    together. This follows the NumPy stubs rather than the Torch stubs, which
    segregate their negative cases into separate directories.
