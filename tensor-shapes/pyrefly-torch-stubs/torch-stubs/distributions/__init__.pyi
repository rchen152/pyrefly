"""
Type stubs for torch.distributions.

Distribution classes track event shape via an `IntTuple`-bound `EventShape`.
rsample() and log_prob() preserve the event shape of the distribution.

Submodules re-exported to support original import patterns:
  pyd.transforms.Transform, pyd.constraints.real, etc.
