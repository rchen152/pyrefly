# `Generator` is not defined anywhere in this package, and resolving it relies
# on how a partial stub package is looked up. The `py.typed` file here contains
# the word `partial`, which tells the type checker this package covers only some
# of `torch`: for a submodule the package does not define, the checker falls
# back to the real torch stubs. `torch._C` is one of those, so `Generator` comes
# from torch itself.
#
# That fallback is per-module rather than per-name. Defining this module shadows
# torch's version of it outright, so every supported top-level name must be
# declared here.
