"""Shared harness for the tensor-shape stub test suites.

Each stub package validates its stubs two ways: Pyrefly checks the test files
statically, and the same files execute against the real library. This module
holds the parts that do not vary between packages -- locating a Pyrefly binary,
locating the shared virtualenv, and running suites.

Nothing here touches the network. The virtualenv is created only by
`bootstrap_venv.py`, so a caller without egress gets an actionable error naming
the fix instead of a hang or an opaque proxy failure.
