//! `tsp/get_computed_type_unopened_cached`: durable regression coverage for
//! the solve-reuse behavior added behind D118537886 ([pyrefly][PR] Commit the
//! solve behind a type query on an unopened file).
//!
//! Before that fix, every `typeServer/getComputedType` request against a file
//! the client had never opened solved the whole module from scratch (to
//! `Step::Solutions`, `Require::Everything`) and threw the result away once
//! the response was sent -- so an *identical, repeated* request on an
//! unchanged snapshot paid the full solve cost every single time. After the
//! fix, the first such request commits its solve, so later requests on the
//! same snapshot reuse it instead of re-solving.
//!
//! This benchmark drives a real TSP server (indexing disabled, so the only
//! background work is a recheck this benchmark never triggers) over the
//! plain in-process main JSON-RPC connection -- the dispatch code that
//! commits an unopened-file solve
//! (`TspServer::dispatch_tsp_request`/`handle_get_computed_type`) treats a
//! request from the main connection and one from a real "extra connection"
//! identically, so the extra connection's own transport plumbing adds
//! complexity without exercising any more of the fix's logic. It repeats the
//! same `getComputedType` request, on a stable snapshot, against one
//! never-opened, unreferenced module deliberately expensive to solve (nested
//! generic constructors -- see [`fixture_source`]). Server spawn, fixture
//! generation, and the first (necessarily cold) request all happen outside
//! Criterion's timing; only the repeated request is measured, so this
//! benchmark is exactly the steady-state behavior the fix changes.
